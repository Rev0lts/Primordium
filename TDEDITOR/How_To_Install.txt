DESCRIPTION
=============================================================

TextDraws with a few mouse clicks! Everything is based
on a graphical interface.

INSTALLATION
=============================================================
1. The contents of the "filterscripts" folder must be unpacked into the folder
"filterscripts" in server files.

2. The content of the "scriptfiles" folder should be extracted to the folder
"scriptfiles" in server files.

3. Extract the "NTD_RESOURCES.txd" file into the "models/txd" folder.
which is located in the main game folder.
Path: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas\models\txd

4. The content of the "plugins" folder should be extracted to the "plugins" folder in server files.
Then in "server.cfg" on the "plugins" line, add "sscanf2" ("sscanf2.so" on linux) if you haven't already that is. 
Note: If you are using Linux, you need to download the Linux version of sscanf2!, the
package only contains the Windows version!

USAGE AND COMMENTS

The command is /NTD, this command is only available for RCON!

You will not be able to use it.

ATTENTION: YOU MUST RESTART THE GAME after adding the "NTD_RESOURCES.txd" file to the folder
"Models/txd"! Textures need to load in order for the script to work properly!
